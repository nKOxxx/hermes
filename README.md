# ARES Agent

Run a fleet of AI coding agents in parallel — each in its own isolated git worktree, with real-time streaming, code review, and one-click merge.

ARES is a self-hosted macOS desktop app that lets you orchestrate multiple AI agents (Claude Code, GPT, MiniMax) working simultaneously across your repos. Add a repository, spin up workspaces, assign tasks to different models, watch them work in real time, review the diffs, and merge to main.

## Features

- **Parallel agent execution** — run multiple Claude Code, GPT, or MiniMax agents at the same time
- **Git worktree isolation** — each workspace gets its own branch, no conflicts between agents
- **Multi-model support** — Claude for coding, GPT for research, MiniMax for general tasks, all through a unified proxy
- **Real-time streaming** — watch agent output live as they work (SSE)
- **Code review & merge** — diff viewer with approve/reject/merge workflow, conflict detection
- **Mission control dashboard** — see all agents across all repos in one grid view
- **Cost tracking** — token usage and cost estimates per model, per run
- **SQLite persistence** — all state survives restarts, no external database needed
- **Native macOS app** — Electron with tray icon, keyboard shortcuts, hiddenInset title bar

## Inspiration

ARES was inspired by [Conductor](https://www.conductor.build) — a fantastic app for running parallel Claude Code agents. ARES takes the same core concept and extends it with multi-model support (Claude + GPT + MiniMax), a unified cost tracking proxy, and a self-hosted architecture with no cloud dependency.
